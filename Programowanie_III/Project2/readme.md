# Mendeleev cipher

The program encrypts the given text in such a way that instead of successive letters, the program will enter the atomic number of the element whose chemical symbol is the encrypted letters (not taking into account the case of the letters). Letter spacing is replaced by '*' and word spacing by '**'.

Some texts can be encrypted in several ways, but the encryptor will choose the first possible option.

Some texts cannot be encrypted using this algorithm, in which case the program prints an appropriate message.
